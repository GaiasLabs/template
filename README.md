# Farcaster Mini App and PWA Template

This Next.js template empowers you to rapidly build exceptional Farcaster Mini Apps or Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). Available in two convenient variations, Farcaster-integrated and pure PWA, it equips you with a minimal yet robust setup that ensures your app is instantly installable. Navigation is seamless, safe areas are managed perfectly, and your app content fits neatly between top and bottom navigation bars, delivering an experience as polished as any native application.

We created this template after facing significant frustration ourselves. When developing web apps compatible with Telegram Mini Apps, Farcaster Mini Apps, or standard PWAs, we discovered the complexity hidden behind seemingly simple requirements, such as managing safe areas and navigation bars across various devices. What began as straightforward design quickly turned into a challenging endeavor. This template was born from that struggle, providing exactly the streamlined foundation we wished existed.

Beyond convenience, our template is also about community. Inspired by shadcn’s influential impact on frontend development, we aim to foster consensus on best practices in the Mini App and PWA space. With simplicity, reusability, and ease-of-learning at the core, the template not only saves time, it actively helps elevate your standards and those of your peers.

Using this template is simply a smart decision. You’ll skip hours of tedious setup and immediately deliver a high-quality user experience. Designed specifically for developers proficient with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, the template ensures your development process is fast, clean, and efficient. Contribute, collaborate, and become part of a forward-thinking community that’s setting the bar for mobile and web integration. Your future self, and your users, will thank you.
